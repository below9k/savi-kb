  <div class="ephox-polish-help-h1">About</div>
  <p>Textbox.io is a tool for creating great looking content in online apps. Whether it’s in social communities, blogs, emails, or anything in between, Textbox.io lets people express themeselves on the web.</p>

  <div class="ephox-polish-help-h2">History</div>
  <p>We started in 2012 wanting to build the next great writing tool, initially focusing on email. Since then we’ve refined this core focus on writing and ease of use, releasing Textbox.io as a Developer API in 2013. In 2014 Textbox.io became the first web text editor to support mobile device browsers.</p>

  <div class="ephox-polish-help-h2">Philosophy</div>
  <p>We believe that writing isn’t just a task, it's how we express who we are in a new digital world. The sum of what you write is often far more than the characters on the page. Writing matters, and the tools we use to write should matter too.</p>
